## Contributing Guidelines
Before you can access the mongodb, create a file named ".env", and place it in the project's root directory. Inside it should contain the following:
```shell
DB_CONNECT=mongodb://<user>:<password>@ds047085.mongolab.com:47085/divesocial
```

**Never** push the package itself (this should be handled on your behalf with the `.gitignore` file).
